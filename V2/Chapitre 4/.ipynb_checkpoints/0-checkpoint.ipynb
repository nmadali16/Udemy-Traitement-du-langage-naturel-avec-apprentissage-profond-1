    "GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a word embedding model that converts words into dense vectors, capturing semantic meanings and relationships between words. Instead of using pre-trained embeddings, we will train our own GloVe embeddings using the IMDb dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Use Hugging Face's `datasets` library to load the IMDb dataset.\n",
    "2. Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing sentences.\n",
    "3. Build a co-occurrence matrix.\n",
    "4. Train GloVe embeddings from scratch.\n",
    "5. Compute average GloVe embeddings for IMDb reviews.\n",
    "6. Train a simple classifier using the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDb dataset is a binary sentiment classification dataset containing 25,000 training and 25,000 test reviews. Each review is labeled as positive or negative."
